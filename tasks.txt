- Add Type, Ability, Moves section
- Implement that wrapper on the pokeapi site

==ideas==
- website.com/id/edit for edit mode, no /edit to just view
- implement mobile design for non-editing mode (when you view a pokemon)
  - editing mode should be desktop only
- WILD IDEA: "I feel like there's got to be a way to read the pokemons moves and stats as causing 
the the guide articles and train it to write an article based on a pokemons stats."
    - i.e. generate neural network generated smogon article xD
