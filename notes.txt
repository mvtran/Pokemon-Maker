- Add Type, Ability, Moves section
- Implement that wrapper on the pokeapi site

==ideas==
- website.com/id/edit for edit mode, no /edit to just view
- implement mobile design for non-editing mode (when you view a pokemon)
  - editing mode should be desktop only
- when the stats match an existing pokemon, show all matches in the side?
- WILD IDEA: "I feel like there's got to be a way to read the pokemons moves and stats as causing
the the guide articles and train it to write an article based on a pokemons stats."
    - i.e. generate neural network generated smogon article xD

==fixes==
- make sure to do "npm run build" when changing files like webpack.config.js
- https://babeljs.io to convert from es6 to es5
- if you change things manually in node_modules, heroku does not catch them because it 
    installs everything remotely. might have to move the pokeapi wrapper to another
    folder and tell npm to install it manually (via tarball apparently?)
